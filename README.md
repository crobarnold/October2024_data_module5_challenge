Pymacueticals corporation wanted an analysis of test results involving 249 mice.  There was duplication of date with one mouse subject. The data was cleaned to remove the duplicate data, leaving the analysis to be perform with 248 mice. There were a total of 10 differenent drug treatments in this study that was part of the analysis.

Conclusions drawn from the analyses from the Pymacueticals data suggests:
1.	There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, as the weight of the mouse increases, the average tumor volume also increases
2.	The bar graph shows that Capomulin and Ramicane had the most number of mice tested.
3.	Capomulin and Ramicane came up top as the most effective at reducing tumor sizes of the mice.
4.	The analysis showed that Infubinol and Ceftamin were the two of the drugs that was least effective at reducing the mice tumor sizes.
